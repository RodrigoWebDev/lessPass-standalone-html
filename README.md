# LessPass standalone HTML

This is a standalone single file HTML version of [lessPass](https://www.lesspass.com/#/).

## Why?

I love lessPass, but I want it to work as a single HTML file that I can easily open in any system(it just need a browser), store anywhere I want and work offline with no installation

## How to use

Just download de `index.html` file and open in a browser
